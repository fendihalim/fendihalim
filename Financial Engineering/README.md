# Financial Engineering Projects
### 1. [Credit Risk Modeling of Corporate Bonds](https://github.com/fendihalim/fendihalim/blob/main/Financial%20Engineering/credit-risk-modeling)
- The purpose of this project is to model a credit-risky portfolio of corporate bonds using several Monte Carlo Approximation models and compare the VaR and CVaR outputs. 100 counterparties and their information such as credit drivers, credit state migration probabilities, losses in credit states, etc. have been prepared to be analyzed.
- The first step is to create 100,000 out-of-sample scenarios. This will represent true distribution of portfolio losses. The next step is to generate the first in-sample scenarios (Monte Carlo Approximation 1) with 1000 systemic scenarios and 5 idiosyncratic scenarios, totaling 5000 scenarios. Next, generate Monte Carlo Approximation 2 which contains 5000 systemic scenarios and 1 idiosyncratic scenario, totaling 5000 scenarios. On the contrary from Monte Carlo Approximation 1 (MC1), MC2 will take longer to compute due generating more random number. Not only that, VaR and CVaR output should be closer to true distribution’s outputs.

- The VaR and CVaR of both graphs look similar with the true distribution of VaR and CVaR.
- To minimize impacts of sampling error, increase the samples / scenarios so that it is closer to the true distribution. In addition to that, Monte Carlo Approximation 2 with extra steps in having more samples is preferred as y (systemic risk random number) is newly generated for every scenario so that approximation is closer to the true distribution. To minimize impacts of model errors, the correct distribution (non-normal) must be used. Normal distribution cannot be used because the result is underestimated compared to the real value.
### 2. [Portfolio Strategies Implemented on 2008 Market Crash](https://github.com/fendihalim/fendihalim/blob/main/Financial%20Engineering/financial-optimization-simulation)
- Seven investment strategies were implemented to build a portfolio which are *Buy and Hold Stategy*, *Equal Weight Strategy*, *Minimum Variance Strategy*, *Maximum Sharpe Ratio Strategy*, *Equal Risk Contribution*, *Leveraged Equal Risk Contribution*, and *Robust Mean-Variance Optimization*.
- The time horizon of this project is in between 2 January 2008 to 31 December 2009 (market crash period). There will be rebalancing period which happens every two months. In the beginning, the initial portfolio contains 902 shares of HOG and 17500 shares of VZ in which the portfolio value is around USD 1M. Selling and buying transactions however have transaction fee in which 0.5% of the traded volume. Portfolio re-balance happened on the first trading day of each 2-month holding period (up to 12 re-balance during 2 years).
- CPLEX solver was used to solve optimization problems such as *Minimum Variance Strategy*, *Maximum Sharpe Ratio Strategy*, *Equal Risk Contribution*, *Leveraged Equal Risk Contribution*, and *Robust Mean-Variance Optimization*.

- All the strategies have started going down since January 2008 and has a trough around March and April. All the strategies bounced back up again but they all went down and suffered a huge dip in January 2009. After that all the strategies are slowly making a comeback. As depicted on the daily plot, leveraged ERC suffered the most as it has the biggest dip compared to other strategies.
- Minimum variance portfolio strategy with rebalancing every 2 periods is the preferred choice because it is the safest option since the portfolio will have the minimum variance portfolio so the risk should be the lowest.
### 3. [Portfolio Strategies Simulated on 2020 COVID Crash](https://github.com/fendihalim/fendihalim/blob/main/Financial%20Engineering/financial-optimization-simulation)
- The setup for this project is similar to project 2 except the time horizong of this project is in between 2 January 2020 to 31 December 2021 (COVID-19 period).

- Initially, the graph started the same and stayed close to each other and started to decline around March 2020 due to coronavirus crash. The major dropped phenomenon is obvious as depicted in the graph by being the lowest point of all these 4 graphs. Even though the market suffered a huge loss, the graphs made a comeback around April, and they escaped from the valley. 
- In this case, maximum Sharpe ratio strategy with rebalancing every 2 periods is the preferred choice because it gives almost double of what the portfolio starts with, and the graph depicts that it doesn't fluctuate to below 1M at all after the 2020 market crash rebound in April.
### 4. [Option Pricing with Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo Simulation](https://github.com/fendihalim/fendihalim/blob/main/Financial%20Engineering/option-asset-pricing)
- This project is about asset pricing on European Option and Knock-in Barrier Option using Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo Simulation. Information such as spot price, strike price, risk-free rate, etc. are provided but number of steps and number of simulations can be selected under user’s discretion.
- The payoff for European call option is the average of maximum between price at time T minus strike price and 0. The payoff for European put option is the average of maximum between strike price minus price at time T or 0.
- Knock-in barrier option has similar characteristics in calculating the payoff. For this option to be activated, the stock price must hit the barrier. If the barrier price is above spot price, it is called up-and-in barrier option. On the contrary, if the barrier price is below spot price, it is called down-and-in barrier option. If the barrier is not hit, then the option is worthless.
