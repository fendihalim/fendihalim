- Seven investment strategies were implemented to build a portfolio which are *Buy and Hold Stategy*, *Equal Weight Strategy*, *Minimum Variance Strategy*, *Maximum Sharpe Ratio Strategy*, *Equal Risk Contribution*, *Leveraged Equal Risk Contribution*, and *Robust Mean-Variance Optimization*.
- The time horizon of this project is in between 2 January 2008 to 31 December 2009 (market crash period). There will be rebalancing period which happens every two months. In the beginning, the initial portfolio contains 902 shares of HOG and 17500 shares of VZ in which the portfolio value is around USD 1M. Selling and buying transactions however have transaction fee in which 0.5% of the traded volume. Portfolio re-balance happened on the first trading day of each 2-month holding period (up to 12 re-balance during 2 years).
- CPLEX solver was used to solve optimization problems such as *Minimum Variance Strategy*, *Maximum Sharpe Ratio Strategy*, *Equal Risk Contribution*, *Leveraged Equal Risk Contribution*, and *Robust Mean-Variance Optimization*.

- All the strategies have started going down since January 2008 and has a trough around March and April. All the strategies bounced back up again but they all went down and suffered a huge dip in January 2009. After that all the strategies are slowly making a comeback. As depicted on the daily plot, leveraged ERC suffered the most as it has the biggest dip compared to other strategies.
- Minimum variance portfolio strategy with rebalancing every 2 periods is the preferred choice because it is the safest option since the portfolio will have the minimum variance portfolio so the risk should be the lowest.
