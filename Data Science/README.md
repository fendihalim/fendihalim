- Built a recommender system model to make predictions related to Am*zon Music Reviews. Given a user and review data, predict the review's star rating (1 to 5) as accurately as possible. Notebook outlines the process of building this system including data exploration and preparation, model interpretation, and insights of the resulting model and analysis. 
- Raw dataset contains 150,000 music reviews which some information that can be informative while others are unnecessary and noisy. Therefore data exploration, data cleaning, feature engineering, and feature selection were implemented to ensure the highest data quality. 
- Predictors used for machine learning were *Logistic Regression*, *Linear SVC*, *Linear Regression*, *Decision Tree*, *XGBoost*, and *Random Forest.*

### 2. [Covid Hierarichal Clustering](https://github.com/fendihalim/fendihalim/blob/main/Data%20Science/COVID_Clustering/covid-clustering.ipynb)
- Data set over 400,000 scholarly articles, including over 150,000 with full text, about COVID-19 were being analyzed to gain useful insights about COVID-19 and how we might be able to tackle the outbreak, contain the spread, flatten the curve, and improve vaccination efforts. 
- Hypothesis: What do abstracts from COVID-19 journals say about **PPE, medicine, disinfect, exercise, and diet**?
- Word2Vec is selected as the model selection for this topic because Word2Vec can detect synonymous words. For example, eat has a word similarity with consume. This model will be utilized with selected keywords from hypothesis.
### 3. [Ordered Logistic Regression](https://github.com/fendihalim/fendihalim/blob/main/Data%20Science/ordinal_logistic_regression_survey/ordinal-logistic-regression-survey.ipynb)
### 4. [[NLP] Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/fendihalim/fendihalim/blob/main/Data%20Science/twitter_sentiment_election/twitter-sentiment-election.ipynb)
